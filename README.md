# React-Messenger-Deployed
This is a messaging web app that allows users to chat one on one or with a group of friends. The messages are stored in the backend but only for a day then the backend is refreshed.
The number of users who can use it is limitless.

## Usage
It's relatively easy to use and only requires you to add your name to the left-most input.
Replace `Ryan` with your name. When you want to see how your message appears to another user, just pick another name.  
You can also delete a message by clicking on the message.

## Installing
To run the app, simply do a `git clone https://github.com/ryann254/React-Messenger-Deployed.git`, cd into the cloned project, then do a `yarn install`. 
Lastly type in `yarn start` in your terminal to run the project.
